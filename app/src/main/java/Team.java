    /* My Vision for the Team Feature */

    /* As a user I'd like to add players to my team so I can track stats for them. This will be
    quicker than scrolling through all Tech's players. If Players are objects rather than just
    names (Strings) they can be assigned stats. Totals like "Eli had 6 Aces this set" would be
    great.

    Players are unique, identified by name and number. I'll only need to add players to a team once
    but players will be accessed often to update or read stats.

    I'd like to present the user with a list of "default players" from which to select their team.
    That means I'll probably have to add another activity to do the team building. I could also add
    the option to create and add totally new players to their team. The list will require an a new
    ArrayAdapter.
